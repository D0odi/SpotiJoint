# SpotiJoint

A Android/IOS app that integrates Spotify API for interactive purposes.

## Description

As a Spotify user myself, I felt that the social interaction aspects of Spotify were a bit underserved. So I created an app where I could incorporate my own features, 
such as joining listening sessions, reacting to friends' current playing tracks, and overall developing a more robust social environment - one closer to more generic social media apps.

## Technologies used
### Frontend
- React Native
- Expo
- React Navigation
- React Native Reanimated
- Socket.IO Client
- REST API calls to backend/Spotify API
### Backend
